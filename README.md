# 3D Definite Integral Visualization

## Overview
This project provides an **interactive GUI** for visualizing the **definite integral** of a function in a 3D space. Users can input integration limits for **x** and **y** to explore how the function behaves within the given region.

The visualization helps in understanding **double integrals** by generating a colorful **3D plot** representing the integration volume under the surface.


## Mathematical Concept

The program is based on double integrals, which are used to compute the volume under a surface over a given region:

where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the integration limits for \( x \).
- \( c \) and \( d \) are the integration limits for \( y \).
- \( f(x, y) \) is the function being integrated.
- \( dy \) and \( dx \) represent the integration order.

This integral computes the **total accumulated value** of the function over the given rectangular region \( [a, b] x [c, d] \).

### How to Use
1. **Enter the integration limits**: Set values for \( x_{min}, x_{max}, y_{min}, y_{max} \).
2. **Click 'Generate'**: The program will compute and display the 3D plot.
3. **Explore the plot**: Rotate, zoom, and analyze the integral visualization.
